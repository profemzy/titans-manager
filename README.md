5. Add charts and graphs using `Chart.js` or `Recharts`.

#### Deliverables:
- Frontend pages developed.
- Integration with backend APIs.
- Authentication system working.
- Visualizations added.

---

### Phase 5: Testing
#### Tasks:
1. Perform unit testing for backend APIs using Django's testing framework.
2. Test React components using `React Testing Library`.

4. Perform User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with stakeholders.
5. Fix bugs and optimize performance.

#### Deliverables:
- Unit and integration tests passed.
- UAT feedback addressed.
- Bug-free application.

---

### Phase 6: Deployment
#### Tasks:
1. Set up Azure infrastructure:
   - Azure App Service (backend).
   - Azure Static Web Apps (frontend).
   - Azure SQL Database and Azure Blob Storage.
2. Deploy Django backend to Azure App Service.
3. Deploy React frontend to Azure Static Web Apps.
4. Configure custom domain and SSL.
5. Set up Azure Monitor for performance tracking.

#### Deliverables:
- Backend and frontend deployed to Azure.
- Custom domain and SSL configured.
- Monitoring system in place.

---

### Phase 7: Training and Support
#### Tasks:
1. Train company staff on how to use the app.
2. Provide user manuals and video tutorials.
